instructions:
  commit_msg: |-
    Analyse a diff and write a concise, informative and well-formatted commit message.
    The commit message should clearly and accurately summarize the changes in the diff.

    ## Format

    ```
    Short summary of what changed and why it changed

    (optional) Longer description of the changes, not everything should be
    explained, especially not the obvious things.
    ```

    ## Guidelines

    For the short summary:
    - Use the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" nor "changes".
    - Capitalize the first letter.
    - No dot (.) at the end.
    - Keep it short (ideally 50 characters or less, definitely under 72).
    - Focus on *what* was changed and *why*.

    For the optional long description:
    - Use the imperative, present tense.
    - Wrap lines at 72 characters.
    - Explain the *what* and *why* of the change, *not the how*. The code itself explains the *how*.
    - Include motivation for the change and how it addresses the issue.
    - Can be ignored if the change is very simple or already well-explained in the short summary
  idea_graph: |-
    I will present an idea.
    Ask me one question at a time about this idea so we can develop a simple, flexible plan than can later be expanded and adapted if needed.

    Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have:
     1. A set of steps.
     2. A simple identifier for each step (human readable using kebab-case).
     3. And a dependency graph between the identifiers.

    Let's do this iteratively and not go into the details, we want to create a flexible outline than can later be refined in a just-in-time manner.
    Remember, only one question at a time.

    # Idea
  analyse_diff: |-
    Analyse a diff to find mistakes.
    One mistake per line, no code, no details.

    Lines starting with `-` are present in the original file but removed in the new version.
    Lines starting with `+` are added in the new version.
    Lines starting with a space are unchanged context lines present in both versions.
